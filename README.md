# SARSA-Temporal-Difference-Learning-in-Python
These code files implement the on-policy SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) reinforcement learning algorithm in Python. 

Explanation of the code files:

- "functions.py" - definition of the class "SARSA_Learning" that implements the SARSA temporal difference learning algorithm 
- "driverCode.py" - driver code that explains how to use "SARSA_Learning" class
