# SARSA-Temporal-Difference-Learning-in-Python
These code files implement the on-policy SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) reinforcement learning algorithm in Python. To test the code, we use the Frozen Lake OpenAI Gym environment. You can also use the Gymnasium environment, for more details, see "driverCode.py"

Explanation of the code files:

- "functions.py" - definition of the class "SARSA_Learning" that implements the SARSA temporal difference learning algorithm 
- "driverCode.py" - driver code that explains how to use "SARSA_Learning" class
